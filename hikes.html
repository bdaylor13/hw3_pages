      <p>
        Over the years, I’ve hiked all across the U.S. and beyond. Each trail offers something unique, from mountain peaks and quiet forests to breathtaking lake views. Hiking is more than just exercise; it’s a form of mindfulness and adventure. Every hike feels like its own story, a mix of challenge, discovery, and appreciation for nature’s beauty.
      </p>

      <p>Here are a few of my all-time favorites that stand out for their beauty and challenge:</p>

      <ul>
        <li><strong>Mount Monadnock, NH:</strong> A classic New England climb with 360° summit views.</li>
        <li><strong>Mount Washington, NH:</strong> The tallest mountain in New England, offering rugged terrain and sweeping vistas.</li>
        <li><strong>Acadia’s Beehive Trail, ME:</strong> Short but thrilling climb with ocean views and iron rungs for an adventurous ascent.</li>
        <li><strong>Blue Hills Reservation, MA:</strong> My local go-to for a quick nature fix and a great place to unwind after a busy week.</li>
      </ul>

      <p>
        Whether you're new to hiking or experienced, these trails offer something for everyone, and they’re all reminders that adventure is often closer than you think. Each trail brings a sense of accomplishment and peace that’s hard to find anywhere else and that’s what keeps me heading back to the mountains whenever I can.
