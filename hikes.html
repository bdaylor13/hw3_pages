        Over the years, I’ve hiked all across the U.S. and beyond. Each trail offers something unique, from mountain peaks and quiet forests to breathtaking lake views. 
        Hiking is more than just exercise; it’s a form of mindfulness and adventure. Here are a few of my all-time favorites that stand out for their beauty and challenge:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li><b>Mount Monadnock, NH:</b> A classic New England climb with 360° summit views.</li>
        <li><b>Mount Washington, NH:</b> The tallest mountain in New England.</li>
        <li><b>Acadia’s Beehive Trail, ME:</b> Short but thrilling climb with ocean views.</li>
        <li><b>Blue Hills Reservation, MA:</b> My local go-to for a quick nature fix.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Whether you're new to hiking or experienced, these trails offer something for everyone, and they’re all reminders that adventure is often closer than you think.
