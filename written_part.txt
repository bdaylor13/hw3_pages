Style Choices:

I implemented three main customizations to make the website visually appealing and unique:
1. Custom Fonts & Typography:
- I set the font to 'Trebuchet MS', sans-serif for a clean, readable style.
- Headers (h1 and h2) have different sizes to create visual hierarchy between the home page and the second page.
2. Color Scheme:
- Header uses a dark green background (#2f5233) to reflect a nature/hiking theme.
- Main content background is a light, soothing color (#f0f8f5).
- Footer uses a soft background (#e8f0eb) with complementary text color (#555).
- Navigation links change color slightly on hover to improve user experience.
3. Layout & Spacing:
- Centered the main content with max-width: 800px for readability.
- Added custom margins and padding to sections and images to make the site visually balanced.
- Images have rounded corners and are displayed centered on the page.
- Navigation links are spaced and styled to be clear and user-friendly.
4. Additional touches:
- Clickable LinkedIn link in the footer.
- Navigation bar allows seamless movement between Home (index.html) and Hikes (hikes.html).
- Lists and headings formatted for readability.
