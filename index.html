        Hi! I’m Brady, a data science and math student at Northeastern University who’s passionate about hiking, travel, and the outdoors. 
        Hiking gives me a chance to disconnect from technology and connect with nature — whether it’s exploring the trails in New England or climbing peaks while traveling abroad. 
        I started hiking in high school with friends and quickly fell in love with it. Over the years, I’ve tackled everything from short day hikes to multi-day treks, and each one leaves me with a new story and a fresh appreciation for the environment.

        This site highlights some of my favorite hikes, along with tips for anyone looking to get started. I hope it inspires you to lace up your boots and explore the trails yourself!
